    <p>Dear {{recipient}}</p>
    <p>How are you? I hope that you are having a nice weekend. I'm vacationing in the Iceland while I learn programming!</p>
    <p>{{recipien}}, you would nit believe how cold it is here. I should have gone to Hawaii instead.</p>
    <p>But I like programming a lot, so I've got that going for me.</p>
    <p>Looking forward to seeing you soon. I'll bring you back a souvenir</p>
    <p>Cheers,</p>
    <p>Travel Enthusiast {{sender}}</p>
